- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hrishimehta1

I created Deal2Watch.com in 2021 to assist my consumer base (400+) in finding deals fitted for them.
The site allows users to search for items they desire by using our keyword search engine to find items from our catalog consisting of thousands of items
from across the web. Than once the user finds an item they can go and add it to their wishlist on the website. The main feature of this website is the deal
scraper created; this functionality scours the web for the best deals on all the products on our catalog consistently throughout a day, updating every 2 hours
or so. Once our deal scraper has found a deal in relation to our customers wishlist, our newly updated alert system will alert the customer through email about
the BEST available deal. When I say BEST i mean it. The deal scraper not only finds the best deals across the web, but compares their value to offer the best 
deal to the customer. Once alerted about these deals, the customer is routed back to our website and redirected via link to where the deal is. This way we 
have maintained a loyal customer base. 

**At this moment Deal2Watch.com is under reevaluation, as a new update should be released in the coming year, as well as a re-release of the website**
