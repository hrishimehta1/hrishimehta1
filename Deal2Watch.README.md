- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hrishimehta1

I created Deal2Watch.com in 2021 to assist my consumer base (400+) in finding deals fitted for them.
The site allows users to search for items they desire by using our keyword search engine to find items from our catalog consisting of thousands of items
from across the web. Than once the user finds an item they can go and add it to their wishlist on the website. The main feature of this website is the deal
scraper created; this functionality scours the web for the best deals on all the products on our catalog consistently throughout a day, updating every 2 hours
or so. Once our deal scraper has found a deal in relation to our customers wishlist, our newly updated alert system will alert the customer through email about
the BEST available deal. When I say BEST i mean it. The deal scraper not only finds the best deals across the web, but compares their value to offer the best 
deal to the customer. Once alerted about these deals, the customer is routed back to our website and redirected via link to where the deal is. This way we 
have maintained a loyal customer base. 


***** HOW IT WORKS ******

1. Add products you want to your price alert list

Type the name of the product you want into search box and within seconds, our product engine will find the best offers from thounsands of merchants. See something you're insterested in? Add it to your Price Alert list by clicking the "Add to Watch List" button.

2. We'll monitor the prices of all the products you want to watch

Several times each day, our Product Watch system will automatically search the web for the best price for every products on your watch list, checking to see if the any of the prices have match your criteria you set.

3. You'll get an price match email notificaion

As soon as any product in your watch list match set price, we'll send you an email notification alert, and all you have to do is click the link in the email to take advantage of the sale price. But act quickly because some deals don't last long!

4. You just saved money by using our service

That's awesome.
